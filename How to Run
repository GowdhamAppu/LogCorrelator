        This Apps used to check the devices are up and running or not based on alert message came from Orion.
   How to Run?
1)	Log Correlator
                   It retrieves data from syslog table and check messages which are came from Orion server and process only those messages.
                  It does pingtest at both end of devices if ping fail then it adds InternalCircuit ID and SLAState in CoreCircuitState table.
                To start Log Correlator
                         Command:  logcorrelator
                         Purpose: To start Log Correlator process as background
                          First it checks logcorrelator process already started or not .If logcorrelator process already started then display “Log Correlator process already started” message.
               To kill Log Correlator
                        Command: logcorrelator kill
                        Purpose: To kill LogCorrelator process.
                        First it checks logcorrelator process running or not. If running, then it kills otherwise it display “LogCorrelator process not yet started” message.
  
2)	Send Mail
    It retrieves data from corecircuitstates table and checks GOCFlag set as “NO” or not. If NO, then it gets details about that internalCircuitID and checks pingtest on from both ends. If ping fail, then it sends mail to intended users.

To start Send Mail 
         Command: sendmail
         Purpose: To start sendmail Process as background
                         First it checks sendmail process already started or not. if sendmail process already started then display “sendmail process already started” message.
                 To kill send Mail
                           Command: sendmail kill
                           Purpose: To kill sendmail process.
                           First it checks sendmail process running or not. If running, then it kills otherwise it display “sendmail process not yet started” message.

3)	To show/add/update/delete CoreCircuitDetails
          To perform various operation on CoreCircuitDetails table.
           Command: show circuit details
           Purpose: It asks user to select which operation to be performed (add/update/show/delete) on CoreCircuitDetails table. Once user select the operation from list then it calls respective methods to do that operations.


4)	To show/delete CoreCircuitStates
        To perform various operation on CoreCircuitStates table.
        Command: show circuit state
        Purpose: it asks user to select which operation to be performed(delete/show) on CoreCircuitStates table.

5)	Email Acknowledge
             It reads the operator mail and checks acknowledge string is present in body message or not. If string “Acknowledge “present, then reads the subject and delete InternalCIrcuitIDs details from CoreCircuitStates table.
     To start Email Acknowledge process
         Command: emailAck
          Purpose: To start Email Acknowledge Process as background
                         First it checks Email Acknowledge process already started or not. if Email Acknowledge process already started then display “Email Acknowledge process already started” message.
                     To kill Email Acknowledge
                           Command: emailAck kill
                           Purpose: To kill Email Acknowledge process.
                           First it checks Email Acknowledge process running or not. If running, then it kills otherwise it display “Email Acknowledge process not yet started” message.
